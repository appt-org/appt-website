# Linting - .NET MAUI

In MAUI, there is no linting tool itself, but the [`.NET build command`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/errors-warnings) (included in Visual Studio, Visual Studio for Mac, Visual Studio Code, and many other IDEs and text editors) always provides warning messages when code may have potential errors.

```csharp
// No code required
```
