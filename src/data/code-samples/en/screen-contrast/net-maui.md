# Contrast - .NET MAUI

In MAUI, you can use the [`Accessibility Scanner`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/accessibility/testing#accessibility-scanner) and [`Xcode's Accessibility Inspector`](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Accessibility/Conceptual/AccessibilityMacOSX/OSXAXTestingApps.html) to detect contrast issues automatically.

```csharp
// No code required
