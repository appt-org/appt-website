# Target size

Ensure interactive elements, such as buttons, have a target size of at least 24x24 points in size. This allows users to easily activate targets. Targets can be smaller if there is sufficient spacing (24 points) between them. This reduces accidental activation of adjacent elements.

- Apple's [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/buttons#Best-practices) recommend a target size of 44x44 points.
- Google's [Material Design Accessibility Guidelines](https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/7101858?hl=en) recommend a target size of at least [48x48 dp].
