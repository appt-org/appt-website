# Transcript on Flutter

Videos should contain a transcript to allow users to read what is shown in media, such as a video or podcast.

A basic transcript contains information needed to understand what is being said. This mostly benefits people who are deaf or hard of hearing, or have difficulty processing auditory information.

A descriptive transcript also contains visual information to understand what is being shown. This mostly benefits people who are blind or visually impaired.
