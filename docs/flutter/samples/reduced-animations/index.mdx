# Reduced animations on Flutter

Content which conveys a sense of motion can be a barrier for users. Certain groups, particularly those with attention deficit disorders, find moving content distracting, making it difficult for them to concentrate on other parts of your app. You should provide functionality to pause, stop or hide content which moves, blinks or scrolls automatically.
