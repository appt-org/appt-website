# TalkBack: screen reader for Android

The built-in screen reader for Android devices is called TalkBack. A screen reader makes it possible to use apps without sight. Gestures allow you to navigate through apps and perform actions. TalkBack is available on Android phones, tablets and watches.

Download our free [ScreenReader app](https://screenreader.app) to learn TalkBack gestures and actions.

## Turn on TalkBack

You can enable TalkBack in the following ways:

### Way 1: via settings

1. Open the Settings app
2. Scroll down, tap Accessibility
3. Tap TalkBack
4. Turn on the switch

### Way 2: Via Shortcut

1. Open the **Settings app**
2. Scroll down, tap **Accessibility**
3. Tap **Volume key shortcut**
4. **Turn on** the switch
5. Tap **Shortcut service**
6. Tap **TalkBack**
7. Tap **Allow** in the dialog box
8. Press and hold **both volume buttons** for three seconds

**Note:** this only works on devices with Android version 8 or higher.

## Turn off TalkBack

If you get confused with the gestures, the easiest way to turn off TalkBack is the second way: press and hold both volume buttons for three seconds.

If you're using an older device, your only option is to navigate back to the TalkBack settings via gestures.

## TalkBack gestures

With version 9.1 of TalkBack, a lot has changed in the gestures. In previous versions of TalkBack, there were only one-finger gestures. In the new version, gestures that require multiple fingers have been added.

In general, TalkBack gestures were perceived as more difficult compared to VoiceOver. Making the right angles is difficult and therefore sometimes goes wrong. TalkBack version 9.1 changes this. Multi-finger gestures have been added as an alternative to angled gestures.

**The main gestures to learn are:**

- Touch the screen with 1 finger to explore
- Swipe right with 1 finger to go to the next element
- Swipe left with 1 finger to go to the previous element
- Tap the screen twice with 1 finger to activate an item
- Swipe left, right, up, or down with 2 fingers to scroll in that direction

Note: it will often happen that you cannot fully control apps with TalkBack.
