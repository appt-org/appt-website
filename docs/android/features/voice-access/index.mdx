# Voice Access for Android

By activating Voice Access it is possible to control your Android device via voice. This is especially useful for users who have difficulty using the touchscreen.

Voice Access is available for all devices with Android version 5.0 or higher.

## Install Voice Access

Before you can install Voice Access, you must first meet the following preconditions:

1. Your device must have Android 5.0 or higher
2. The [Google app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox) must be installed

In addition, the following three things are recommended:

1. Set up **“Ok Google”** detection from any screen:
   - Open the Google app, tap More in the bottom right, then Settings, then Voice Settings. Then tap "Voice" and turn on "Ok Google."
2. Check if you have downloaded a language for offline use:
   - Go back to the previous screen and click on 'Offline Speech Recognition'. Download the desired languages.
3. Use the Pixel Launcher. [Download the app here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.nexuslauncher).

Finally, install the [Voice Access app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.accessibility.voiceaccess).

## Turn on Voice Access

After you install Voice Access, you can only turn it on in way 1 the first time.

### Way 1: via settings

1. Open the **Settings app**
2. Tap **Accessibility**
3. Tap **Voice Access**, found under the 'Downloaded services' heading
4. Turn on the **Switch**

Then turn off the **'Time out after no speech'-switch** in the Voice Access settings.

### Way 2: Via Shortcut

1. Open the **Settings app**
2. Scroll down, tap **Accessibility**
3. Tap **Volume key shortcut**
4. Turn on the **Switch**
5. Tap **Shortcut service**
6. Tap **Switch Access**
7. Press and hold **both volume buttons for** three seconds

**Note:** this only works on devices with Android version 8 or higher.

## Turn off Voice Access

Saying **“Stop listening”** or **“Thanks, Google”** disables Voice Access.

You can also turn off Voice Access via the settings. You can also try long-pressing both volume buttons. This way you can disable Voice Access via a shortcut.

## Voice Access commands

After you turn on Voice Access, numbers appear on the screen with all the elements to perform actions.

For example, if you see the number 7 next to a "Save" button, you can perform actions in the following ways:

- 7
- Save
- Click 7
- Click Save

In some apps, it's easier to navigate with a grid than by clicking on specific elements. A grid is also useful if the element you want to click on does not have a number.

- Say **“Show grid”** to start grid selection.
- Say **“More squares”** or **“Less squares”** to make the grid larger or smaller.
- To interact with the grid, say a number or use commands. For example: **“Tap 3”** or **“Long press 3”**.
- Say **“Hide grid”** to hide the grid again.

**Note:** it will often happen that you cannot fully control apps with voice control.
