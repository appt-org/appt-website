# Keyboard Access for Android

It is possible to control your Android device with an external keyboard. You can navigate and perform actions by pressing keys on the keyboard. Keyboard controls are available on Android phones and tablets.

## Connect keyboard

Connecting a keyboard is the first step to getting started with keyboard access.

For Android, we recommend connecting a Windows keyboard. However, you can also connect a Mac keyboard. In the table below you can see how the keys relate to each other.

| Windows | Mac |
| --- | --- |
| Windows | Command |
| Ctrl | Control |
| Alt | Option |

You can connect the keyboard in two ways: via Bluetooth or via the USB port.

### Way 1: via Bluetooth

1. Open the **Settings app**
2. Tap **Connections**
3. Tap **Bluetooth**
4. Turn on the switch
5. Turn on your Bluetooth keyboard
6. Wait for the keyboard to appear under **Available devices**
7. Select the keyboard to start connecting
8. Follow any on-screen instructions.

**Your keyboard should now be under the Currently Connected** heading.

### Way 2: Via USB Port

You connect the keyboard by plugging the cable into the port. The connection of the keyboard must be the same as the port of your device. Usually, this is not the case, you have to purchase an adapter.

First check which USB port your device has. New devices have a USB-C port, older devices have a Micro-USB port.

Then check the keyboard connection. The most common is a regular USB connection, you will then need an adapter. There are also keyboards, especially for Android with USB-C or Micro-USB connections.

## Control via keyboard

Now that you have connected the keyboard, you are probably wondering how you can now operate your device. The most important things to know are:

- **Tab** : navigate to next element
- **Arrow Keys** : Navigate Lists
- **Space** : activate selected element

An app should be fully operable with these three keys. Unfortunately, most apps don't take keyboard controls into account. It will often happen that you cannot fully control apps with keyboard access.

In the tables below you will find key combinations which are available.

### Overview

You can show an overview of available shortcuts. On Windows keyboards, press  **Windows + /**  to do this. On Mac keyboard, use  **Command + /** . In the overview, the search glass represents the Windows and Command keys respectively.
