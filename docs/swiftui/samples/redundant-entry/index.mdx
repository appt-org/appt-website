# Redundant entry on SwiftUI

Ensure that users are not asked to re-enter information during a multi-step process, instead allow previously entered data to be auto-populated or available for selection. This helps to reduce cognitive load and prevents errors, especially for users with memory challenges or cognitive disabilities. Exceptions apply when re-entering data is essential, for security reasons, or if the information has become invalid.
