# Target size on SwiftUI

Ensure interactive elements, such as buttons, have a target size of at least 24x24 points in size. This allows users to easily activate targets. Targets can be smaller if there is sufficient spacing (24 points) between them. This reduces accidental activation of adjacent elements.
