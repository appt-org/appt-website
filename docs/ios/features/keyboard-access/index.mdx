It is possible to control your iOS device with an external keyboard. You can navigate and perform actions by pressing keys on the keyboard. Keyboard controls are available on iPhone, iPad, and iPod. However, the functionality is less extensive on iPhone and iPod compared to iPad.

## Connect keyboard

Connecting a keyboard is the first step to getting started with keyboard control.

For iOS we recommend connecting a Mac keyboard. However, you can also connect a Windows keyboard. In the table below you can see how the keys relate to each other.

| Mac | Windows |
| --- | --- |
| Command | Windows |
| Control | Ctrl |
| Option | Alt |

*Difference between keys on Mac and Windows.*

You can connect the keyboard in two ways: via Bluetooth or via the charging port.

### Way 1: via Bluetooth

1. Open the **Settings app**
2. Tap **Bluetooth**
3. Turn on the Bluetooth **switch**
4. Turn on your Bluetooth **keyboard**
5. Wait for the keyboard to appear under **Other devices**
6. Select the keyboard to connect to

**Your keyboard should now be under the My Devices** heading.

### Way 2: Via Charging Port

You connect the keyboard by plugging the cable into the charging port. The keyboard connector must be the same as your device's charging port. Usually, this is not the case, you have to purchase an adapter.

First, check which charging port your device has. New devices have a USB-C port, older devices have a Lightning port. They both have the same shape. The Lightning port is slightly wider and slightly narrower than the USB-C port.

Then check the keyboard connection. The most common is a standard USB connection, you will then need an adapter. There are also keyboards, especially for iOS with USB-C or Lightning connection.

## Enable extended keyboard features

You should now have connected your keyboard to your device. To operate your entire device with the keyboard, the extended keyboard functions must be turned on. This is how you do it:

1. Open the **Settings app**
2. Scroll down, tap **Accessibility**
3. Scroll down, tap **Keyboards**
4. Tap **Extended Keyboard Features**
5. Turn on the switch for **Extended keyboard** functions
6. Select the keyboard to connect to

You can now use all available keyboard shortcuts to control your device.

## Control via keyboard

Now that you have connected the keyboard, you are probably wondering how you can now operate your device. The most important things to know are:

- **Tab** : navigate to next element
- **Arrow Keys** : Navigate Lists
- **Space** : activate selected element

An app should be fully operable with these three keys. Unfortunately, most apps don't take keyboard controls into account. It will often happen that you cannot fully control apps with keyboard access.

In the tables below you will find keyboard shortcuts that are available.

### Overview

Long-press the **Command** key to display an overview of the available shortcuts. On Windows keyboards, you have to press the **Windows** key for this. Please note at the time of writing this only works on iPad.
