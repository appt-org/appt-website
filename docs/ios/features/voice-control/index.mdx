# Voice Control for iOS

With Voice Control it is possible to perform actions via your voice. You can tap specific elements on the screen by speaking the corresponding number or label. There are hundreds of commands that allow you to fully control your device. The Appt Foundation has worked them out for you.

Voice Control is available on all devices with iOS 13 or later.

## Turn on voice control

The first time you use voice control you need to turn it on in the following way:

### Way 1: via settings

1. Open the **Settings app**
2. Tap **Accessibility**
3. Tap **Voice Control**
4. Turn on the switch

### Way 2: Via Siri

1. Activate Siri ( **“Hey Siri”** )
2. Say: **“Turn on voice control”**

### Way 3: Via Shortcut

1. Open the **Settings app**
2. Tap **Accessibility**
3. Scroll to the bottom, tap **Accessibility shortcut**
4. Tap **Voice Control**
5. Press the side button or home button three times.

## Turn off voice control

The fastest way to turn off Voice Control is with the command: **“Turn off Voice Control”**. In addition, you can also turn off voice control via Siri: **“Turn off Voice Control”**.

While voice control is activated it is still possible to navigate via touch. You can turn off voice control again via the Settings app. Tap Accessibility, tap Voice Control, and turn off the switch.

If you have set up a shortcut for VoiceOver, you can also turn it off again this way.

## Using Voice Control

The most useful command to learn voice control is:  **“Show me what to say”**. This command shows which commands are available for the current screen. In this way, you learn more and more commands to operate apps.

Note: unfortunately it will often happen that you cannot fully control apps with voice control.

## Customize Voice Control

You can adjust voice control to your wishes. You can enable or disable specific commands and even create custom commands.

### Enable or disable commands

Open the Settings app, tap Accessibility, tap Voice Control, and tap Customize Commands.

Then select the group in which the command falls, for example, 'Basic navigation'. Then select the command, for example, 'Open App Switcher'.

Now you are on the screen where you can turn the command on or off via the switch.

### Create command

Open the Settings app, tap Accessibility, tap Voice Control, tap Customize Commands, and tap Create New Command…

Enter a phrase you want to use to activate the command. For example: 'Enter first name'.

Then tap "Action" and select "Insert text." A text field will appear, in this case, enter your first name here.

Then tap 'Back' and finally 'Save' to save the command.

You can now have your first name entered in text fields to say 'Enter first name'.
