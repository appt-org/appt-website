# VoiceOver: screen reader for iOS

The built-in screen reader for iOS devices is called VoiceOver. A screen reader makes it possible to use apps without sight. Gestures allow you to navigate through apps and perform actions. VoiceOver is available for iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch.

Download our free [ScreenReader app](https://screenreader.app) to learn VoiceOver gestures and actions.

## Turn on VoiceOver

You can enable VoiceOver in the following ways:

### Way 1: via settings

1. Open the **Settings app**
2. Tap **Accessibility**
3. Tap **VoiceOver**
4. **Turn on** the switch

### Way 2: via Siri

1. Activate Siri (**“Hey Siri”**)
2. Say: **“Turn on VoiceOver”**

### Way 3: Via Shortcut

1. Open the **Settings app**
2. Tap **Accessibility**
3. Scroll to the bottom, tap **Accessibility Shortcut**
4. Tap **VoiceOver**
5. Press the **side button** or **home button three times**

## Turn off VoiceOver

If you get confused with the gestures, the easiest way to turn off VoiceOver is via Siri: “Hey Siri, turn off VoiceOver”.

It is of course also possible to turn VoiceOver off again via the Settings app. However, you will have to navigate here via the VoiceOver gestures.

If you have set up a shortcut for VoiceOver, you can also turn it off again this way.

## VoiceOver gestures

It's helpful to learn some basic gestures first. You will not be the first person to turn VoiceOver on, after which it will not be possible to turn it off again.

Swiping to the right takes you to the next element. Swipe left to go to the previous element. 

Double tap to activate an element. These three gestures will get you a long way.

**The main gestures to learn are:**

- Touch the screen with 1 finger to explore
- Swipe right with 1 finger to go to the next element
- Swipe left with 1 finger to go to the previous element
- Tap the screen twice with 1 finger to activate an item
- Swipe left, right, up, or down with 3 fingers to scroll in that direction

Note: it will often happen that you cannot fully control apps with VoiceOver.
