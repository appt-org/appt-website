# Focus not obscured on iOS

Ensure that the item with keyboard focus is at least partially visible on the screen. This helps people relying on a keyboard or assistive devices like speech input to navigate. Fully hidden focused items due to sticky headers, footers, or other content can confuse users or block navigation.
