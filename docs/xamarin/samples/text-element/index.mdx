# Text element on Xamarin

Always use text elements to display text, unless this is not possible due to styling, such as text logo's. Text elements give users the flexibility to adapt the size and font to their preference. The font size inside an image often scales to a limited extent, or not at all. Make sure not to constrain the height of text elements as it will cut off the text when font-scaling is applied.
