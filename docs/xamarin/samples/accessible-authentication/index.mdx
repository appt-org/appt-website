# Accessible authentication on Xamarin

Ensure that authentication methods, such as logging in, do not require cognitive tests like remembering a password or solving puzzles, which can be challenging for people with cognitive disabilities. By enabling methods like password managers, two-factor authentication options, and biometric verification, apps can ensure that authentication is accessible and easier for all users.
