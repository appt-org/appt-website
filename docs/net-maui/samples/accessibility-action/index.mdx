# Accessibility action in .NET MAUI

Accessibility actions provide alternative ways for users of assistive technologies to perform actions. For users of [switch control](https://appt.org/en/docs/ios/features/switch-control) it can be difficult to use drag-and-drop functionality. This functionality can be made more accessible by providing accessibility actions to move items up and down.
