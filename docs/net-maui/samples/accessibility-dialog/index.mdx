# Accessibility dialog in .NET MAUI

A dialog overlays the screen and offers one or more actions to proceed. Dialogs should always include a close button to make them accessible for users of assistive technologies. Furthermore, the focus of assistive technologies should be trapped inside the dialog while it's visible.
