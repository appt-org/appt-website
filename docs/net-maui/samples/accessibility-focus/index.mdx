# Accessibility focus in .NET MAUI

Sometimes you need to programmatically move the accessibility focus to a specific element. For example, when you present a modal, the assistive technology should move it's focus to it. Or when moving to a new screen, you might want assistive technologies to focus a specific element.

<CodeSample id="accessibility-focus" platform="net-maui" locale="en"/>
