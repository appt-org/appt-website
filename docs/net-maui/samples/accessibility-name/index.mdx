# Accessibility name in .NET MAUI

All interactive elements must have an accessibility name. The accessibility name is used by assistive technologies to inform users about the ways to interact with your app.

For apps, the `accessibility name` is usually equal to the `accessibility label`. See [accessibility label](https://appt.org/en/docs/net-maui/samples/accessibility-label) for more ways of setting an accessibility label.
