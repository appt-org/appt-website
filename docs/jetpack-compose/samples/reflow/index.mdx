# Reflow in Jetpack Compose

Content on the screen should reflow based on the users' preferences. In landscape mode, the vertical space is much smaller compared to portrait mode. And when users have enlarged their font size, text should not get truncated. Instead, apps should adapt the interface to the available space.
