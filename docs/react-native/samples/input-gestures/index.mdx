# Input gestures on React Native

Gesture activated functionality should also be available without the use of gestures. Not everyone is able to make all gestures. For example, for users with limited mobility it might be difficult or impossible to make the 'pinch-to-zoom' gesture. You should provide buttons to zoom in and out as an alternative.
