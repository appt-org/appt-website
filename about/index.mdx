# About us

The Appt® platform is an initiative of the Appt Foundation, a non-profit organization. Our mission is to make apps accessible for everyone. We try to achieve this by sharing free knowledge and open-source code.

The Appt Foundation was established in The Netherlands, in November 2020. In the first two years, knowledge was shared in Dutch on the website appt.nl. In January 2022, we received funding to build an international platform. On 22 September 2022, we launched a beta version at beta.appt.org. On 30 January 2023, we launched the completed version of appt.org 🎉.

We have no employees, but work together with [partners](/en/partners) and individual experts. Are you passionate about making apps accessible?
