# Screen reader

A screen reader reads out what is on the screen in an app. Gestures allow you to navigate through apps and perform actions. In this way it is possible to use apps without sight. 

The screen reader on Android devices is called TalkBack. iOS devices also have a built-in screen reader: VoiceOver.

The screen reader is a useful tool for people with disabilities. Don't be fooled by the low usage rates. This setting is a necessity for some people. For example, blind and partially sighted people generally cannot live without it. 

But it is also a powerful tool for developers to test an app for accessibility. An app that is useful with a screen reader must include textual alternatives and all essential elements must be easily accessible and focusable. This benefits a much larger group than screen reader users. People who use external devices, such as a keyboard or a switch, also benefit from an app that works well with a screen reader.
