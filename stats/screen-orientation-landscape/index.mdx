# Screen orientation landscape

On Android it is possible to disable the automatic screen rotation when the phone is rotated. In that case, the screen will retain its last orientation. This feature is important for people who have their screen mounted on something, such as a wheelchair. Or cyclists who attach their device to the handlebars. 

Most apps have been developed purely for vertical portrait orientation. When the screen is fixed in the horizontal position, those apps will be less useful.

- On iOS you can lock your screen to portrait orientation, make sure screen lock is disabled when testing.
- On Android you can lock your screen to the most recent orientation, make sure this lock is disabled when testing.

At the moment we are not measuring screen orientation on iOS yet.
