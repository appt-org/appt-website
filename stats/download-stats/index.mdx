# Download the stats

Which accessibility settings Dutch people actually use on their phones? To answer that question, we started a quantitative study into activated accessibility features in apps we develop. The motivation for this research was to prove that accessibility of digital products is much more important than many people assume. And it shows in the results we share on this website.

Some of our key findings:

1. [Half of all people use accessibility features.](/en/stats)
2. [More than a third adjust font size.](/en/stats/font-size)
3. [Over a third have activated dark mode on iOS.](/en/stats/dark-mode)
4. [Many iOS users use the zoom function.](/en/stats/zoom)
5. [Many Android users have live subtitles activated.](/en/stats/closed-captions)
