# Voice control

It is possible to control an app with your voice via voice control. A grid appears on the screen with various numbers or labels. By speaking these numbers or labels you can perform certain actions.

**Voice Access** can be installed on Android devices to control apps via your voice. **Voice Control** is built-in as standard on iOS devices.
