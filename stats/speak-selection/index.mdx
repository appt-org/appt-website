This feature allows text to be read aloud. When you select a piece of text, the option to have it read aloud appears.

This feature is used not only by people with an visual impairment, but also in situations where users cannot look at the screen: in a car, for example. People with autism or focus and concentration problems also use this setting. And it is used not only by people with disabilities, but also in situations where users cannot look at the screen, such as in the car.

This feature is available on both iOS and Android. If we extrapolate our measurements to all Dutch residents with an iPhone, we are talking about a group of more than 250,000 people.

## VoiceOver

By the way, having a selected text read aloud is not the same as [VoiceOver](/en/stats/screen-reader). Our results do not show any significant use of voice-over. But speak screen and speak selection, like VoiceOver, need good labelling.

<Quote
  quote="My iPhone is my third eye."
  name="Jeroen"
  imageSrc="/img/light/Blinde app gebruiker Jeroen.jpg"
  alt="Jeroen - Asset"
  linkLabel="Read the interview with Jeroen"
  url="/en/articles/jeroen"
/>

## Support in apps

Non-text content such as buttons and images must be labeled. Below you'll find an explanation how it can be added to an element in native and cross-platform apps.
