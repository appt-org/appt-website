# Shake to undo

iOS has the shuffle recovery accessibility feature. This feature undoes the last text entry when the phone is shaken, making it easy to delete text.

People turn off this option if there is a risk that they will activate it unintentionally, for example through trembling hands or when checking apps frequently in a shaking bus or tram. The extrapolated figure comes to more than 400,000 Dutch people.
