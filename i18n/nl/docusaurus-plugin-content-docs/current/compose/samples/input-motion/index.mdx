# Input motion in Jetpack Compose

Provide an alternative way for actions activated by motion, to allow everyone to use the functionality. For example, for users with limited hand function, shaking is not always possible. Also make it possible to disable actions activated by motion. For example, for users with spasms, these actions could be triggered accidentally.
