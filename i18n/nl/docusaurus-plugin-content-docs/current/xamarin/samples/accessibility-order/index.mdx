# Accessibility order on Xamarin

Assistive technologies try to determine a logical accessibility order based on the placement and properties of the elements on the screen. In Left-to-Right languages, the order goes from top to bottom, from left to right. If this order is not optimal, you can override the accessibility order that assistive technologies follow.
