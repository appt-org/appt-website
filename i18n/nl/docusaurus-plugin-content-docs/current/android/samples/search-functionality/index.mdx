# Search functionality on Android

Users might have difficulty finding a specific screen. For example, inside a banking app, there might be a setting for enabling contactless payments. Users likely need to navigate through multiple screens to reach before reaching this setting. It helps to offer search functionality to jump directly to this screen.
