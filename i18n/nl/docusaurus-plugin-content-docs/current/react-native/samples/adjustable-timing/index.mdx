# Adjustable timing on React Native

Everyone, including people with disabilities, should have adequate time to interact with your app. People with disabilities may require more time to interact with your app. If certain functions are time-dependent, it will be difficult for some users to finish in time. If content is shown for a limited time, users might not finish reading in time. It should be possible for users to increase time limits, or ideally, disable all time limits.
