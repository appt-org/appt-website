# ArcTouch

ArcTouch helps companies forge meaningful connections with their customers through lovable apps, websites, and connected experiences that are useful, delightful to use, and inclusive.

We follow an [Accessibility First](https://arctouch.com/blog/accessibility-first-app-development) mindset, and believe inclusive design and development best practices should be built into a product from day 1. Our accessibility services include:

- Accessible strategy, design, and development of native apps and websites for companies of all sizes
- Usability testing with people with disabilities
- Remediation of existing native apps and websites to make them more accessible
- Coaching and training to help your organization build more inclusive products

ArcTouch helps serve on the [W3C Mobile Accessibility Task Force](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/matf/) and partners with the Appt Foundation to continue building on their industry-first open-source accessible code sample library.

Letâ€™s build something lovable together!
