# How does text enlargement work in an app?

On the phone you can turn on text enlargement in the system settings. Switching it on works differently on each device. You can usually find the option by searching for “text”. By setting the text size to maximum, you can see whether your app supports text enlargement and whether this causes problems.

- **Android**: Settings → Screen → Font size
- **iOS**: Settings → Accessibility → Display & Text Size → Larger Text
