# Native versus cross-platform frameworks to develop accessible apps

It's important to consider accessibility when developing an app. Over 1 billion people in the world [have a disability](/en/articles/disabilities). And 50% of all people [use accessibility features](/en/stats) on their mobile devices.

A question we are often asked is: *"Which framework should I choose to develop an accessible app?"*

In this article, we are comparing the pros and cons of Android, iOS, Flutter, React Native and Xamarin. And we added Web equivalents. A conclusion is drawn at the end.

## 1. Orientation

Apps should support multiple orientations (portrait and landscape) to ensure users can hold devices in their preferred way.

| Framework | Feature | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Android | [android:screenOrientation](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element#screen) | All orientations supported by default |  |
| iOS | [UISupportedInterfaceOrientations](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/uisupportedinterfaceorientations) |  | 'Upside Down' disabled by default |

## 2. Text scaling

Apps should support text scaling, to ensure users can read text in the font size they need.

| Web | [aria-live](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions) |  | Less control |

## Conclusion

So, which framework do we recommend for accessible app development? Native frameworks provide the best accessibility support.

It may not be feasible to maintain two codebases and two development teams. Fortunately, cross-platform frameworks are expanding their support for accessibility features.

But beware, when using cross-platform frameworks you may not be able to access certain accessibility features due to layers of abstraction. If you want to develop the most accessible app, native is always the best choice.

| Framework | Score | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Android | 100% | Full support |
| iOS | 100% | Full support |
| Web | 100% | Full support |
| Flutter | 90% | Good support, lacks accessibility focus change |
| React Native | 90% | Good support, lacks accessibility order change |
| Xamarin | 50-80% | Mediocre support, lacks accessibility state/value, requires 3rd party libraries |
