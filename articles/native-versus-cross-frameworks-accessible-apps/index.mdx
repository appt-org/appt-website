# Native versus cross-platform frameworks to develop accessible apps

It's important to consider accessibility when developing an app. Over 1 billion people in the world [have a disability](/en/articles/disabilities). And 50% of all people [use accessibility features](/en/stats) on their mobile devices.

A question we are often asked is: *"Which framework should I choose to develop an accessible app?"*

In this article, we are comparing the pros and cons of Android, iOS, Flutter, React Native and Xamarin. And we added Web equivalents. A conclusion is drawn at the end.

## 1. Orientation

Apps should support multiple orientations (portrait and landscape) to ensure users can hold devices in their preferred way.

| Framework | Feature | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Android | [android:screenOrientation](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element#screen) | All orientations supported by default |  |
| iOS | [UISupportedInterfaceOrientations](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/uisupportedinterfaceorientations) |  | 'Upside Down' disabled by default |
| Flutter | [setPreferredOrientations](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/services/SystemChrome/setPreferredOrientations.html) | Flexible |  |

| Xamarin | [Device Orientation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/user-interface/layouts/device-orientation?tabs=macos) or native | Flexible |  |
| Web | [@media query](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries) | Extensive |  |

## 2. Text scaling

Apps should support text scaling, to ensure users can read text in the font size they need.

<Image src="/img/light/scaling.png" alt="Screenshot of an app with increased font size, none of the text is truncated"/>

| Framework | Feature | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## 3. Contrast

Apps should have sufficient contrast, to ensure users can read text and distinguish interface elements.

<Image src="/img/light/contrast.png" alt="Screenshot of an app, text colors are picked using a color picker, the contrast ratio is 4,77:1"/>

| Framework | Feature | Pros | Cons |

## 8. Focus order

Apps should provide a logical focus order, allowing users of assistive technologies to navigate efficiently.

<Image src="/img/light/order.png" alt="Screenshot of an app, showing the focus order using numbers displayed by Voice Control"/>

| Platform | Feature | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## 9. Focus change

Apps might need to move the focus of assistive technologies, to ensure users end up at the right element.

<Image src="/img/light/focus.png" alt="Screenshot of an app showing two scenarios where you might forcefully move the focus of assistive technologies, e.g. after scanning a QR-code or entering a pincode"/>

## 10. Status messages

Apps should communicate major interface changes to assistive technologies, to ensure users know what's going on.

<Image src="/img/light/status.png" alt="Screenshot of an app announcing a status message for screen reader users when loading or when errors are displayed"/>

| Platform | Feature | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| Web | [aria-live](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions) |  | Less control |

## Conclusion

So, which framework do we recommend for accessible app development? Native frameworks provide the best accessibility support.

It may not be feasible to maintain two codebases and two development teams. Fortunately, cross-platform frameworks are expanding their support for accessibility features.

But beware, when using cross-platform frameworks you may not be able to access certain accessibility features due to layers of abstraction. If you want to develop the most accessible app, native is always the best choice.

| Framework | Score | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Android | 100% | Full support |
| iOS | 100% | Full support |
| Web | 100% | Full support |
| Flutter | 90% | Good support, lacks accessibility focus change |
| React Native | 90% | Good support, lacks accessibility order change |
| Xamarin | 50-80% | Mediocre support, lacks accessibility state/value, requires 3rd party libraries |
