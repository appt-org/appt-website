# New code samples for WCAG 2.2

We are pleased to announce that the Appt Foundation has released new code samples for WCAG 2.2. Code samples for Swift and SwiftUI are now available for Level A and AA success criteria.

- [2.5.7 Dragging Movements](https://appt.li/2.5.7)
- [2.5.8 Target Size (Minimum)](https://appt.li/2.5.8)
- [3.2.6 Consistent Help](https://appt.li/3.2.6)

## Help us expand

We want to expand these code samples to include Android, Jetpack Compose, Flutter, React Native, .NET MAUI, and Xamarin â€” and we'd love your help!

If you're experienced with any of these frameworks, check out our article [Contribute code samples for accessible apps](/en/articles/contribute-code-samples-for-accessible-apps) to learn how to contribute.

Below are six code samples ready for implementation. Choose your framework and click "Contribute" to find the relevant file in our open-source repository.

Have questions? Don't hesitate to reach out to Jan Jaap at [janjaap@appt.org](mailto:janjaap@appt.org). We're excited to collaborate with you!
