## Help us expand

We are looking for help to expand these code samples to Android, Jetpack Compose, Flutter, React Native, .NET MAUI and Xamarin.

If you have knowledge of any of these frameworks, we ask you to share your knowledge with us.

In our article [Contribute code samples for accessible apps](/en/articles/contribute-code-samples-for-accessible-apps) you can read more about the contributing process.

The 6 new code samples have been embedded below. Choose your framework, and press the "Contribute" button to find the location of the file in our open-source repository.
