# Appt samples package published

We're excited to announce [`@appt.org/samples`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@appt.org/samples), a new NPM package that provides code samples for building accessible apps.

The package offers over 400 code samples to create accessible apps using Android (XML), Jetpack Compose, iOS (UIKit), SwiftUI, Flutter, React Native, .NET MAUI and Xamarin.

[Abra](/en/partners/abra) has funded this project and [Mart-Jan Roeleveld](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mart-jan/) ([Q42](/en/partners/q42)) wrote the package.

## Configuration

The package works with any build system through our loader interface. It includes built-in support for Webpack.

```bash
npm install @appt.org/samples
```

Configure your bundler, create a loader, and start querying:

```javascript
import { createWebpackLoader, getTopic } from '@appt.org/samples';

// Create a webpack context that includes all markdown files
const webpackContext = require.context(
  '@appt.org/samples/samples',
  true, // Include subdirectories
  /\.md$/, // Only include markdown files
  'lazy' // Only load a sample when it is requested in retrieval
);

// Query code samples for `accessibility-label` on `android` and `ios`
const topic = await getTopic(loader, {
  locale: ['en'],
  technique: 'accessibility-label',
  frameworks: ['android', 'ios']
});
```

The `topic` data can be used to render the code samples using your framework of choice.

- `topic.introduction` holds an [`Introduction`](https://github.com/appt-org/appt-samples/blob/f974778ddf9156c1a0d1b96a69702b3aae18d41b/lib/src/types.ts#L9) object
- `topic.samples` holds all [`Sample`](https://github.com/appt-org/appt-samples/blob/f974778ddf9156c1a0d1b96a69702b3aae18d41b/lib/src/types.ts#L11) objects

## Rendering

Our [CodeSample component](https://github.com/appt-org/appt-website/blob/a6a696786d31bb06d23d7f300a4668b7fc02454a/src/components/CodeSample/index.tsx) shows how to render these code samples using Docusaurus and React.

```jsx
<CodeSample id="accessibility-label"/>
```

renders as:

> <CodeSample id="accessibility-label"/>
