  title="My iPhone is my third eye"
  description="Since 1992, Jeroen (1974) has had a visual impairment caused by a brain tumor. He has 5% vision with his left eye and 2% with his right eye. So he sees almost nothing. There are also two separate images on the left and right. Jeroen's profession is a sports masseur, and as a hobby he models sculptures with balloons. He also gives workshops to children. The mobile devices he uses are an iPhone 13 Pro, an iPad and an Apple Watch."

## What accessibility features have you set up on your phone?
My iPhone is my third eye. It has a magnification program that I use. Other accessibility features I use are [VoiceOver](/en/stats/screen-reader) and [speech](/en/stats/speak-selection). I can do anything with voice without reaching for my phone. Voice-over is always on and is really necessary for me.

I use Earpods almost all the time, so I hear everything that comes in on my phone. Most of the time I [use just one](/en/stats/mono-audio), because I also want to listen to the environment.

I've set the home button as a menu choice between [zoom](/en/stats/zoom), [inverted colors](/en/stats/invert-colours), [VoiceOver](/en/stats/screen-reader), and magnifying glass. Sometimes I turn inverted colors on when there is a lot of light or with a reflective screen. Then the contract is better in terms of text and I can just see it.
