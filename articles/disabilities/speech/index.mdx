# Speech impairments

Speech impairment is when there are problems with the execution of the speech movements, as a result of which the sounds do not sound right.

The consequence of a speech impairment is that the person pronounces words, sentences or stories unclearly or unintelligibly, while there is nothing wrong with the intelligence or the language ability.

Speech-impaired people face barriers to apps controlled by voice commands or other speech-based services. Examples of a speech impairment are hissing, nasal speech or stuttering.
