# Cognitive impairments

For users who struggle to handle a phone, it is more difficult to use apps.

It is not recommended to use decorative or irrelevant images in an app. In addition, it is important that navigating within an app is simple and with as few actions as possible. This can be made easier by using short sentences and recognizable icons. The use of colour can also help with this.

Users who have difficulty reading often use functions to read the screen aloud. These features work similar to how the [screen reader](/en/stats/screen-reader) works. This just goes to show that multiple groups of users can benefit from better accessibility.
