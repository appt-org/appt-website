# Hearing impairments

Users with hearing loss may also have difficulty using apps that are not adapted for them.

For hearing impaired users, the possibility to connect their hearing aid to a phone is increasing. Unfortunately, apps do not always take the desired audio settings into account. For example, an option is to hear both audio channels of a stereo recording in both ears. However, apps regularly prefer their own settings over the system settings, which means that sound can be missed. In addition, apps may not transmit their audio to a paired hearing aid at all.

Deaf users would like if an alternative way to receive signals can be chosen. For example through vibration instead of sound. Apps can set different vibration patterns. Another option is to use a visual signal through the camera flash. Unfortunately, these alternative ways are often not available.
