# Automated accessibility testing of Android and iOS apps

It is essential that developers incorporate accessibility features into their apps in order to provide a great user experience for all users. You can run automated accessibility tests to check if your Android or iOS app meets the [accessibility requirements](/en/guidelines). This process can be used to detect issues that prevent users from using your app such as [poor contrast](/en/guidelines/wcag/success-criterion-1-4-11), [missing labels](/en/guidelines/wcag/success-criterion-1-1-1), or [missing name, role or values](/en/guidelines/wcag/success-criterion-4-1-2).

## Automatically test the accessibility of an app

Automated accessibility tests can be used on both Android and iOS devices, and they can be performed in a variety of ways. Most commonly, automated accessibility tests are performed using a platform-specific tool, such as [UI Automator on Android](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/other-components/ui-automator) and [XCTest on iOS](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest). In addition, there are cross-platform tools such as [Appium](https://appium.io/), and framework tools such as [Widget Tests on Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/testing#widget-tests) and [Component Tests on React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/testing-overview#component-tests).

When using these tools, you need to write your own accessibility tests. For example, you can write a test case where you check whether an accessibility label has been set for an image. Or you can check whether the accessibility role ‘button’ has been applied to all buttons in your app.

Fortunately, there are also people who have written automated accessibility tests for you.
