# WCAG Beginners' Guide

You want to make your app accessible but don't know where to start? The WCAG is a good starting point. But which guidelines are relevant for your app?

The guidelines are made up of 78 success criteria. Which ones you have to take into account depends on where in the world your app is available. The way in which accessibility is guaranteed and mandated by the government differs considerably per region.

In Europe, [EN 301 549](/en/guidelines/en-301-549) is used to guarantee accessibility from the law. This includes 44 success criteria that you should take into account. In the United States [Section 508](/en/guidelines/section-508) is used for this. Which includes 34 success criteria.

## Ten criteria to start with

To make it easier to get started, we've put together a list of ten criteria that are most common to have failures in apps. By paying attention to these ten success criteria, you will not build a fully accessible app but you will prevent up to 85% of the most common accessibility errors.

### How this list came about

The findings of a number of recent audits, investigations and quick scans have been combined. This gives a lot of insight into which accessibility errors are most common in apps. Paying attention to these common errors will resolve up to 85% of accessibility errors. These audits were performed by [Abra](/en/partners/abra) for various ministries, developers and municipalities.
