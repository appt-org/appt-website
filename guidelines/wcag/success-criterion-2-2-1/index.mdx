Ensure everyone has enough time to complete tasks. People with disabilities might need more time to navigate through a screen. Operating an app with assistive technologies is often slower compared to touch. People with learning disabilities, dyslexia and cognitive impairments might also need more time. If there are time limits, users need to be able to adjust the time limit. It's best to avoid time limits.

## Impact

- People with a motor-impairment who use switch access need much more time to operate an app.
- People with learning disabilities, dyslexia and cognitive impairments may also need more time.

## Check

“*Is it possible to adjust time limits?*“

This can be tested without the use of assistive technologies.

## Solution

### Make timing adjustable
