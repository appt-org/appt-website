Ensure users can operate the interface with one finger using simple gestures. Not everyone is able to pinch-to-zoom or trace a certain path. Provide an alternative, such as a button, that allows the user to perform the same action.

## Impact

- It can be difficult for people with a motor disability to use multiple fingers. By offering an alternative, they can use the same functionality.
- It can be difficult for people with a motor disability to make path-based gestures. Make sure that path-based gestures are not necessary to operate the app.

## Check

“*Is an alternative available for multipoint and path-based gestures?*“

This can be tested without assistive technologies. The table below lists examples of gesture types.

|Type          |Examples                                                             |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Single pointer|One finger clicking, tapping, pressing, swiping                      |
|Multipoint    |Pinching, rotating, multi-finger clicking, tapping, pressing, swiping|
|Path-based    |Tracing, drawing, twisting                                           |
