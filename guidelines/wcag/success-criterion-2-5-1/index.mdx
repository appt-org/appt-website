Ensure there is an alternative for gesture-activated actions. Not everyone is able to move two fingers apart or able to swipe. Provide an alternative, such as a button, that allows the user to perform the action.

## Impact

- It can be difficult for people with a motor disability to make swipe gestures. Make sure that swiping is not necessary to reach all information.
- It can be difficult for people with a motor disability to use multiple fingers. By offering an alternative, they can use the same functionality.

## Check

“*Is an alternative available for gesture-triggered actions?*“

This can be tested without assistive technologies.

## Solution

### Provide alternatives for gestures
