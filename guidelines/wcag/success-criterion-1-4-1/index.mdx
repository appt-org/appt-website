Ensure color is not the only way information is conveyed. Not everyone can perceive color. For example, include shape in your instructions, such as a green check mark or red cross. And inside a legend of a map, use numbers in addition to color, to allow people who are color blind to find what they are looking for.

## Impact

- Color can be perceived less well by people who are color blind or who are elderly.
- Use a red cross or green check mark for feedback to make the feedback clear for people who do not perceive color very well.
- With a legend, use numbers in addition to color so that people who are color blind can also find what they are looking for.
- Do not only use color for required fields, but also add text so that blind or colorblind people perceive the field is required.

## Check

*“Is all information on the screen also clear without the use of color?“*

This can be tested visually, no assistive technology is needed.

## Solution

When designing an app, keep in mind that information is not conveyed through color alone.

### Calculate contrast
