# Multiple Ways

Ensure users can reach the screens of an app in multiple ways. For example, onboarding screen are often shown when an app is first launched. You should offer these screens elsewhere in the app so they can be viewed again. A search function can also be useful to jump to a certain screen.

## Impact

A search function helps everyone to find the right information faster. For people who are blind or have a cognitive impairment, it can take longer to find their way through information.

## Check

“*Are multiple ways available to reach the screens in the app?“*

This can be tested without assistive technologies.

Note: this success criterion is exempt for apps in [EN 301 549](/en/guidelines/en-301-549) and [Section 508](/en/guidelines/section-508).

## Solution

### Add search functionality
