Ensure that all functionality in an app can be used via the keyboard interface. This includes external keyboard, screen reader, switch control and voice control. Visually impaired people use a screen reader. People with a motor disability use switch control and voice control.

## Impact

- People who are blind often use a screen reader to operate apps.
- People with limited hand function often have difficulty using the touchscreen. Using a keyboard is a solution for them.
- People with motor disabilities often use switch control or voice control to operate an app.

## Check

“*Can you fully operate the app when using assistive technologies?*“

We recommend to test with at least the [screen reader](/en/stats/screen-reader), [voice control](/en/stats/voice-control), [keyboard access](/en/stats/keyboard-access) or [switch access](/en/stats/switch-control).

## Solution

All interactive elements must be operable with assistive technologies. It can be needed to move the focus of assistive technologies.
