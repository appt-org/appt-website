Ensure there is enough space between paragraphs, letters and words. People with dyslexia can read faster as a result. People who are visually impaired can also read the text more easily. White space can also help people with a cognitive impairment to distinguish parts from each other.

## Impact

- People with dyslexia can read faster if sufficient distance between texts is used.
- People who have poor vision can read more easily if there is sufficient distance between text, words and paragraphs.

## Check

*“Is there enough distance between letters, lines and paragraphs?”*

This can be tested visually, no assistive technologies are needed.

## Solution

### Adjust text spacing

<CodeSample id="text-spacing" locale="en"/>

### Support bold text

<CodeSample id="text-bold" locale="en"/>
