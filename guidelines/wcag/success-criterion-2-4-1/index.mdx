Ensure content which is repeated on multiple screens can be skipped. This is especially important for users of assistive technologies. With assistive technologies you usually navigate through the screen per element. It takes a lot of time if you have to navigate through the entire menu on each screen.

## Impact

A user with a keyboard must first go through a menu structure of several pages before he can read a news article. This costs him a lot of time every time.

## Check

*“Is it possible to skip repeating content when using assistive technologies?“*

This can be tested with a [screen reader](/en/stats/screen-reader) or [keyboard access](/en/stats/keyboard-access).

Note: this success criterion is exempt for apps in [EN 301 549](/en/guidelines/en-301-549) and [Section 508](/en/guidelines/section-508).

## Solution
