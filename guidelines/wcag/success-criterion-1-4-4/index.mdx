Ensure that text can scale. Users set their preferred font size in the system settings. This is especially important for visually impaired users because they might not be able to read the text otherwise. In addition, scaled text may not be truncated, overlap other text or become unreachable.

## Impact

- 1 in 3 users has adjusted their font size, mostly to a larger font size.
- If text does not resize, people with reduced vision will not be able to read text properly.
- When elements do not support multiple lines of text, important text may be lost.

## Check

“*Is text displayed larger when setting a larger font size preference?*“

This can be tested visually, set a larger font size in the system settings.

## Solution

### Support text scaling

<CodeSample id="text-scale" locale="en"/>

### Prevent text truncation

<CodeSample id="text-truncation" locale="en"/>
