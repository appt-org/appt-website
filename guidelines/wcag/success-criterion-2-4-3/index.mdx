Ensure assistive technologies use a logical focus order when navigating. The order of navigating a screen is usually from left to right, from top to bottom. Make sure assistive technologies use an equivalent focus order.

## Impact

People who use assistive technologies such as the screen reader, keyboard, and switch controls benefit from a focus order that makes sense.

## Check

“*Do assistive technologies use a logical order to navigate through the screen?*“

This can be tested with a [screen reader](/en/stats/screen-reader) or [keyboard access](/en/stats/keyboard-access).

## Solution

### Adjust order for keyboard

<CodeSample id="keyboard-order" locale="en"/>

### Adjust order for assistive technologies

<CodeSample id="accessibility-order" locale="en"/>

### Move accessibility focus

<CodeSample id="accessibility-focus" locale="en"/>
