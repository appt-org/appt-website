Ensure headings and labels are descriptive. 

Descriptive headings are important to understand how the content is constructed. Blind users can navigate through headings using a screen reader. 

Descriptive labels help users identify content. Voice control users speak the labels to perform actions.

## Impact

- Blind users can request an overview of all headings on the screen via their screen reader. These headings should be self-explanatory.
- Ensure the labels are linked to the input fields. This allows the screen reader to read the label and input field to users simultaneously.

## Check

â€œ*Is the information on the screen clearly described by headings and labels?"*

This can be tested with the [screen reader](/en/stats/screen-reader).

## Solution

### Add descriptive headings

<CodeSample id="screen-headers" locale="en"/>

### Add descriptive labels

<CodeSample id="screen-labels" locale="en"/>
