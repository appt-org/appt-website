Ensure that content on the screen rotates with the orientation of the device. All screens of an app must be usable in all orientations. Users in wheelchairs sometimes have their device mounted in a fixed position. More words fit on the screen in landscape mode, useful for users with a larger font size.

## Impact

- This is important for users who have their screen mounted horizontally on a wheelchair and cannot rotate it.
- 1 in 3 people use an enlarged font. Horizontal orientation makes text easier to read with a (very) large font.

## Check

*“Does the screen content rotate when you rotate your device?”*

This can be tested visually, no assistive technology is needed.

## Solution

### Allow multiple screen orientations
