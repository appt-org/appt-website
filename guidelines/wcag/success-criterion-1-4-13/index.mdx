Ensure that content shown after hover or focus can be hidden. Content must remain visible until the reason for the hover or focus disappears. In addition, users need to be able to dismiss the content.

## Impact

- Users can get stuck in an app if it is not possible to hide automatically appearing content.
- A menu may open after ho. Users should be able to stop or undo this action.

## Check

*“Can content be hidden if it gets in the way?“*

You can use a pointer of [keyboard](/en/stats/keyboard-access) to check this.

## Solution

Add a close button to content that is automatically displayed to allow users to hide it.

### Add close button
