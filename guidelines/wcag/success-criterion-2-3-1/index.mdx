Ensure no more than three flashes per second are shown anywhere in the app. This can cause an epileptic seizure. Trigger warnings are often missed, especially by people who cannot read, such as children.

## Impact

More than three flashes per second can trigger an epileptic seizure.

## Check

“*Are more than three flashes per second shown anywhere?*“

This can be tested without assistive technologies.

## Solution

### Prevent frequent flashes
