Ensure that audio which lasts longer than three seconds can be paused or stopped. This is important for people who have difficulty concentrating. In addition, the screen reader is difficult to use when other audio is playing.

## Impact

- For screen reader users, it is disruptive to auto-play audio.
- Auto-playing audio can disrupt people who have difficulty concentrating to process information.

## Check

*“Can audio be controlled?“*

This can be tested without the use of assistive technologies.

## Solution

Always provide a pause or stop button when playing sound.

### Add audio control
