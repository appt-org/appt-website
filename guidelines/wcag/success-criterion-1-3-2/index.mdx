Ensure that the order which assistive technologies follow accurately reflects the meaning of the content. Elements that belong together must be presented together. Otherwise, users may misunderstand the content.

## Impact

The content should be presented to assistive technologies in a meaningful way. This  allows users of voice control, keyboard control, switch control and the screen reader to present the content a meaningful way.

## Check

“*Is the order of elements clear for users of assistive technologies?”*

You can use a [screen reader](/en/stats/screen-reader) of [keyboard access](/en/stats/keyboard-access) to check the order of elements.

## Solution

### Set accessibility order
