Users must be able to operate apps with the technologies they use. Ensure functionality is not only operable via touch. People who use a screen reader, voice control, switch control, external keyboard or other assistive technologies should also be able to operate apps.

## Examples

- An app should be operable in multiples ways, including with a [screen reader](/en/stats/screen-reader), [voice control](/en/stats/voice-control), [keyboard access](/en/stats/keyboard-access) and [switch control](/en/stats/switch-control).
- People with disabilities sometimes need more time to navigate through a screen. It is important that the time limits can be extended.
- Some users have [mobility impairments](/en/articles/disabilities/mobility), preventing them being able to shake their phone. Make sure that this kind of functionality can also be activated in other ways.
