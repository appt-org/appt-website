Ensure content can be reached without having to scroll in two directions at the same time. This can cause users to lose their orientation on the screen. Providing horizontally and vertically scrollable content on one screen is permitted, but the content may only scroll in one direction at a time.

## Impact

- Reflow allows visually impaired people to clearly follow where text begins and ends.
- Scaled text might push elements off the screen. This results in a loss of information.

## Check

“*Can all content be reached without scrolling in two directions?*“

This can be tested visually, enable the largest font size.

## Solution

### Support reflow
