# Reflow

Ensure content can be read without having to scroll in two directions at the same time. This is confusing for users. It is allowed to provide horizontally and vertically scrollable content within a single screen.

## Impact

- Reflow allows visually impaired people to clearly follow where text begins and ends.
- Scaled text might push elements off the screen. This results in a loss of information.

## Check

“*Can all content be reached without scrolling in two directions?*“

This can be tested visually, enable the largest font size.

## Solution

### Support reflow
