Ensure the language of the screen is set. Some assistive technologies read text that appears on the screen. The pronunciation of the words depends on the language that has been set. When the language is not set, or when a wrong language is set, the pronunciation is unclear.

## Impact

- Screen reader users can have text read in the correct language.
- Letters can be displayed better when the language is known.

## Check

*“Has the language of the screen been set correctly?“*

This can be tested with a [screen reader](/en/stats/screen-reader).

## Solution

### Set a language

<CodeSample id="text-localization" locale="en"/>
