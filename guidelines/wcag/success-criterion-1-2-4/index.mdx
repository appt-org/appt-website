Ensure real-time captions are available for all live videos with audio. This allows people who need subtitles to directly access the spoken information.

## Impact

- People who are deaf or hard of hearing want to be able to understand what is being said during live videos.

## Check

“*Are real-time captions available for live videos?”*

This can be tested visually, no assistive technologies are needed.

## Solution

The challenge with live captions is both organizational and technical. A captioner must be present who can provide real-time captions for the video by using appropriate software.

### Add live captions
