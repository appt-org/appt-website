Ensure audio description is available when important information is shown which you cannot hear. This can be done by offering an extra audio track. This allows people who are blind or have difficulty processing visual information to also understand the content.

## Impact

- People who are blind cannot perceive visual information from videos, audio description provides this information for them.
- It can be difficult for people with cognitive disabilities to understand what is being shown in videos.

## Check

“*Are visual details in videos described?”*

This can be tested visually, no assistive technologies are needed.

## Solution

### Add audio description

<CodeSample id="media-audio-description" locale="en"/>

## Example

<Video youTubeId="O7j4_aP8dWA" title="Example video with audio descripion" name="Video - Audio Description example"/>
