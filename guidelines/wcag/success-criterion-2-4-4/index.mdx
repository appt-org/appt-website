Ensure the purpose of each link is clear. Users can request a list of links. The link and its surrounding text should indicate where you will navigate to. Clear links are useful for everyone and especially for users of assistive technologies users.

## Impact

Assistive technologies can show an overview of all links on the screen. The purpose of each link should be clear immediately.

## Check

“*Is the purpose of each link clear?*“

This can be tested without assistive technologies.

## Solution

### Mark links

<CodeSample id="accessibility-link" locale="en"/>
