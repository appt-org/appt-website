# Language of Parts

Ensure the language of parts is set. Sometimes pieces of text are written in another language. Set the language so text is read out correctly.

## Impact

- Ensure the language of text written in other languages is set correctly.
- People with screen readers can have parts of text read in another language.

## Check

*“Are foreign texts indicated in their respective language?“*

This can be tested with the [screen reader](/en/stats/screen-reader).

Note: this success criterion is exempt for apps in [EN 301 549](/en/guidelines/en-301-549).
