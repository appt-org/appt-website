Ensure navigation is always in the same place. For example, place the back button in the top left corner. Consistent navigation is especially useful for users of assistive technologies.

## Impact

Anyone can use an app more easily when repeating content is structured in the same way. Especially people with cognitive, intellectual or visual impairments benefit from this.

## Check

“*Is the way of navigation the same on each screen?*“

This can be tested without assistive technologies.

Note: this success criterion is exempt for apps in [EN 301 549](/en/guidelines/en-301-549) and [Section 508](/en/guidelines/section-508).

## Solution

### Use consistent positioning
