Ensure a transcript is provided when information is only conveyed by audio or images. With podcasts, the information is conveyed only through audio. People who are deaf cannot hear what is being said. In animation films, the information is often only conveyed through images. People who are blind cannot see the images.

## Impact

- A transcript can help anyone to understand what is to be seen or heard.
- People who are deaf or hard of hearing can read what is said in audio fragments.
- People who are blind can read what is being be seen in video fragments.
- People who are deafblind can read the written version in braille.

## Check
