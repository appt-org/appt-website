Ensure users submit data intentionally. Allows users to undo, correct, or confirm a submission. Provide at least one of these options for submissions that result in a legal obligation, financial transaction, or loss of data. We recommend offering these options for other types of submission as well.

## Impact

- Everyone benefits from preventing unforeseen consequences.
- Confirming submissions is important for users of assistive technologies because they are more likely make mistakes when entering data.

## Check

“*Is confirmation requested before submissions are final?*“

This can be tested without assistive technologies.

## Solution

### Use a dialog for confirmation
