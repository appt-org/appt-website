Ensure users receive a clear error message after entering incorrect data. Clearly indicate  which entry is incorrect and why. It is important that error messages are also clear to users of assistive technologies. Therefore, also indicate errors in text to allow everyone to perceive them.

## Impact

- Filling in data correctly becomes easier for everyone when error messages are clearly indicated.
- Clear error messages are especially important for people with cognitive, language and learning disabilities.

## Check

*"Are input errors indicated clearly when entering incorrect data?*

This can be tested without assistive technologies.

## Solution

### Show errors

<CodeSample id="input-errors" locale="en"/>

### Use accessibility announcements

<CodeSample id="accessibility-announcement" locale="en"/>

### Use accessibility live region

<CodeSample id="accessibility-live-region" locale="en"/>
