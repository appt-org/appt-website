Ensure that elements focused by assistive technologies are clearly indicated. App developers might not be able to adjust the color of the frame. However, it is possible to give elements a different background color when they have focus.

## Impact

- Apps become more usable when the element with focus is clearly visible.

## Check

“*Is the focus clearly shown everywhere when navigating with assistive technologies?*“

This can be tested with a [screen reader](/en/stats/screen-reader) or [keyboard access](/en/stats/keyboard-access).

Note: apps cannot adjust the color of the focus frame. This can only be done by the user through the system settings.

### Solution

### Add accessibility focus indicator
