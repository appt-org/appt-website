Ensure the source code of the app does not contain any errors and does not use any deprecated functions. Assistive technologies may not behave as expected when code does not conform to modern standards.

## Impact

Users are excluded when an app does not work (properly) on their device.

## Check

“*Is the app technically well put together?*“

We recommend that you regularly perform an (external) code review.

## Solution

### Make use of linting

<CodeSample id="linting" locale="en"/>
