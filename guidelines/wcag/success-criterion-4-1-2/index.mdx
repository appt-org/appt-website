Ensure a correct name, role and value is set for all interactive elements.

The name helps users to identify elements. The screen reader speaks the name and voice control uses the name for actions.

The role lets users know what to expect. The role "button" indicates which action takes place upon activation.

The value informs the user. This includes the state (disabled), properties (selected) and values (50%).

For example, give a tab the name "Home", the role "tab", the property "selected" and the value "1 of 4".

## Impact

- People who use assistive technologies depend on a correct name, role and value.
- If a button has no name then it is not clear what action will take place.
- If a button does not have the role button, then a user will not know that it can be clicked.
- If the value of a switch is not indicated to assistive technologies, a user will not know whether it is on or off.

## Check

“*Are the name, role and value set correctly?*“

This can be tested with the [screen reader](/en/stats/screen-reader).

## Solution

### Set accessibility name

<CodeSample id="accessibility-name" locale="en"/>

### Set accessibility role

<CodeSample id="accessibility-role" locale="en"/>

### Set accessibility value

<CodeSample id="accessibility-value" locale="en"/>

### Set accessibility state

<CodeSample id="accessibility-state" locale="en"/>
