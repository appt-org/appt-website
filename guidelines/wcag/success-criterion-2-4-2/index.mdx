Ensure each screen has a clear title. The title tells users what screen they are on and what they can do. This information is useful for all users to know. And is especially important for people with cognitive disabilities.

## Impact

- For screen reader users, the page title immediately tells them where they are.
- For users with cognitive impairments or those with limited attention, the page title improves their abilities.

## Check

“*Does each screen have a clear title?*“

This can be tested without assistive technologies.

Note: this success criterion is exempt for apps in [EN 301 549](/en/guidelines/en-301-549).

## Solution

### Set screen title

<CodeSample id="screen-title" locale="en"/>
