Ensure it is possible to pause, stop or hide moving elements on the screen. Users may have difficulty using apps with moving elements. For example, flashing content makes it harder for people with attention disorders to stay focused.

## Impact

- The screen reader reads all content. If the content jumps automatically before the screen reader has read everything aloud, the user is missing information.
- The blinking of elements creates a distraction for people with a
cognitive impairment or attention deficit, which makes it difficult to use an app.

## Check

“*Can moving parts be stopped?*“

This can be tested without assistive technologies.

## Solution

### Disable animations
