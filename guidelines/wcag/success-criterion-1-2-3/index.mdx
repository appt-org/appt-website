Ensure a transcript or audio description is provided for videos where you can't hear what is displayed. The content can then be read in case of a transcript, or heard in case of audio description.

## Impact

- A transcript is useful for anyone who has trouble understanding video frames.
- People who are blind can hear what can be seen in videos through an additional audio track.

## Check

*“Is a transcript or audio description available for all videos?”*

This can be tested visually, no assistive technologies are needed.

## Solution

### Add transcript

<CodeSample id="media-transcript" locale="en"/>

### Add audio description

<CodeSample id="media-audio-description" locale="en"/>
