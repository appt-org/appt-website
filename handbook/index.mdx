# App accessibility handbook

The Appt Foundation is working towards a world where everyone can use apps equally. To make this vision a reality, we have written a handbook. It helps you learn the basic principles of app accessibility in a straightforward way.

The Dutch handbook has been distributed over 1400 times on paper, and thousands of times digitally. After the success of our Dutch version, we are writing a new version in English.

We're proud to introduce the new version of our app accessibility handbook soon.
