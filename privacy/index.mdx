The Appt app loads the Appt website, which means it uses the same Local Storage and Cookies. In addition, the Appt app uses [Firebase Analytics](https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics) to collect additional information. We also use [Firebase Crashlytics](https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics) to collect crash logs.
