# Abra

Abra makes apps accessible.

Our software allows you to automatically detect accessibility issues in apps. Use our dashboard and academy to solve the issues together with your team.

We are a big advocate of knowledge sharing. In 2020, this led to the establishment of the Appt Foundation. Since then, we've written over 150 articles and shared over 200 code samples.
