# Partners

The ApptÂ® platform is an initiative of the Appt Foundation, a non-profit organization. Our mission is to make apps accessible for everyone. We try to achieve this by sharing free knowledge and open-source code.

We have no employees, but work together with partners. Our partners would love to tell you more about their motivation to make apps more accessible.
